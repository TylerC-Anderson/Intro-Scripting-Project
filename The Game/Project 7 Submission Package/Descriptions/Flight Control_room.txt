The way to Flight Control is long and you are glad for the map or you would be hoplessly lost.

You find your way to the room and thankfully it is empty, just rows of what you assume to be alien computers. The room is eerily quiet, the computers do not even hum as they work.

Using the Universal Translator you find a machine that says "Hangar Key Printer."

There are no other exits to the room other than the way you came.
