Once the locker dispenses the Cloaking Device you try it on.

Once fully on, there's a zipping sound and suddenly it fits perfectly.

You start to walk but almost fall over because you can't even see your legs, and you trip on your own feet.

After getting more used to this... unique experience, you feel able to move normally. You are ready to continue on.
