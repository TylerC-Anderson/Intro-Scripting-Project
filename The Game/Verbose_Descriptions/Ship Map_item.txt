You walk up to the tear-drop kiosk. The Kiosk seems to sense your approach as it irises open at the top to reveal a circular pad.

"Simple enough," you think, as you place your hand on it to perhaps be served by the machine. Sure enough, a slot opens and out slides a glossy, black tablet. It makes a slight whisper as it slides out the slot.

You take your prize in your hand. It lights up and, under inspection of the Universal Translator, reveals a nice layout of the ship.

You see that the room to the west of Junction 86 is called "Flight Control A". You note after inspecting both EVA Preps (of which there is an East and West version), that they are indeed locked by what's caled the Hangar Key, which the tablet informs you may be found in Flight Control Rooms. To the east of Junction 86 is a strangely long hallway, based on what you've seen so far, that eventually culminates in Armory 4. Armory 4, the Map helpfully informs you, is where Combat Skins as high as Class 15 are held, as well as other items for defensive measures.

You see that north of Junction 09 is another EVA Prep, and to the east of Junction 09 is Weapons Arsenal 01. That DEFINITELY seems promising, as the tablet informs you of both ranged and melee weapons being stored there.
