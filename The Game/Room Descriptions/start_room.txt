You awaken in your cell. You don't know how long it's been, but you lost track after around day 32.

Before then, the last thing you remember is that you were looking up at the stars in the night sky as you are sometimes wont to do. A brief flash of light, that sickly green light, and when you next awoke, you were in this cell. 

Your cell was in its interrogation arrangement when you first awoke, and has returned to that arrangement with unsettling regularity every day since. Each day you knew when they were approaching because the machines hidden in the walls, floor, and ceiling vibrated to life, the very room itself stirring like a monster as you unwittingly entered its maw. The machines barely even made a sound beyond their movement across the room. They would grab you, harsh and deft, like a practiced animal handler. Then you'd be placed on the table as the straps within it locked themselves into place.

You were strapped to that table at least 32 times while they ran their tests and asked you questions in that odd resonant clicking language they have. Peered at you with those awful, silver, compound eyes they have, like a fly coated in mercury.

You were strapped to that table at least 32 times while a creature you have only come to know as the Captain shouted at you. The Captain had its underlings prod at you with their too-long appendages that looked like 9-fingered, skeletal hands ending on an arm shaped like a dog's leg.
