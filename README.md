# Intro-Scripting-Project

This is my work towards the final project for my Intro to Scripting course. To play, simply download zip file and extract it. Then navigate to Intro-Scripting-Project-main\Intro-Scripting-Project-main\The Game\TextBasedGame.py

Project objective was to create a text-based game that accepts user input to
either move the player in the game world, and allow them to pick up items. If
the player moves to the boss room with all items, they win the game!
